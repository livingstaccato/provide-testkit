"""Pytest plugin that disables setproctitle to prevent pytest-xdist issues on macOS.

On macOS, when setproctitle is installed, pytest-xdist's use of it to set worker
process titles causes the terminal/UX to freeze completely. This plugin prevents
setproctitle from being imported by using Python's import hook system.

The plugin uses sys.meta_path to intercept setproctitle imports and raise ImportError,
causing pytest-xdist to gracefully fall back to its built-in no-op implementation.

This approach is clean because:
- It leverages xdist's existing try/except ImportError fallback
- Works in both main process and worker subprocesses automatically
- Requires no manual installation or .venv modification
- Uses standard Python import hook mechanism
