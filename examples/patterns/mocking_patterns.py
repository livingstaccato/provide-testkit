Example: Mocking and Test Double Patterns

This example demonstrates common mocking patterns and test doubles
using provide-testkit's mocking utilities and fixtures.

Key fixtures used:
- temp_directory: For file-based mocking scenarios
- mock_server: HTTP server mocking (if available)
- Various mock fixtures from common module

Learning objectives:
- Understand different types of test doubles
- Learn when to use mocks vs real objects
- Practice mocking external dependencies
- See fixture composition for complex scenarios
