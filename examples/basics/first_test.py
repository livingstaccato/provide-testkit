Example: Your First Test with provide-testkit

This is the absolute simplest example to get you started with provide-testkit.
If you're completely new to testing or provide-testkit, start here!

Key fixture used:
- temp_directory: Creates a temporary directory that's automatically cleaned up

Learning objectives:
- Write your very first test using provide-testkit
- Understand what a fixture is
- See automatic cleanup in action
- Build confidence with testing
